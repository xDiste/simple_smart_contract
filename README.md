# Simple Smart Contract

We want to provide a tiny and simple of smart contract in [Solana](https://solana.com/it) in order to show an example of that.

The idea is to give the possibility of:
* being able to send a small message
* being able to re-read the last message
* being able to re-read the previous message
* being able to know how many messages have been sent up to that moment

We use [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/it) as programming language and [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/) as framework. 
In order to build and deploy the smart contract we used [Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/) and to view all transactions with our smart contract visit [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/address/FBwJwndmZXX94juoWFWku2K139hAG88arFrBwd5zF3nV?cluster=devnet)
